You've probaly traveled here from PT(PonyTown) and must I say, Thanks for dropping in and being curious to learn more about who I am!
I really appreciate those who are capable of emotional regulation & unbiased opinions that are not easily influcened for socail acceptance, meaning that you dont judge others on a first interation basis and form your own opinions with due dillengence. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/752d0184-ee31-426c-9028-24b1b3b54509)

A little about me first(will add more later):
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ead5d30c-eafe-4183-a641-45653a82227c)
I am deslyexic and find reading texts to be difficult, especially when the chatbox moves to fast for me to read! You may need to send your message in a DM to get me to really see it, otherwise please be patient with me! I often type looking at my keyboard and scroll through messages once I've finished speaking. This isnt an excuse of any kind just something you should be aware of if you're choosing to interact with me.

I also have ADHD and will often have short term memory loss or lose focus of what is going on around me, I dont do it on purpose as it's my brain just being jumbled like a can of jelly beans! I'm also at times extremely hyperactive and overly friendly, if that makes you anxious or they are upsetting to you then please communicate that to me or simply hide me. I apologize in advance if you take offense to my energetic behavior but it's no excuse to be a blatant asshole.

Im 26yrs old Female and as an adult I would prefer that minors DO NOT interact with me, if you need help with something then ofc it's okay to ask for guidance but please dont use that as a means to befriend me. I'm in the 18+ server of PT and seeing minors invade adult spaces because they beileve they're "Mature" really pmo, you're just as bad as the adults who on the PG server and do creepy things. No one wants to catch a case, surely NOT me, therefore my relationship with minors is and always be from a proffesional interaction & nothing more. Im also an RDA, so my play hours may differ from week to week, or such so please be patient when contacting me ad it's best to do so on discord.

I bully bullies. Simply as that. If I catch you blatantly bullying someone without probable cause, I will call you out on it. Why choose to be an asshole and show everyone you're incapable of working through your traumas? Imo that's both sad and funny asf to openly want to bully someone over the most silliest things, you obviously deserve to be treated poorly if your're doing that to others. Treat others the way you want to be treated and that includes me as well. Hint Hint, see the self accountablility there? It's really NOT that hard to comprehend ^^

A littelt about my Likes & Dislikes:

I thoroughly enjoy MLP & PT, however on many occasion I find myself segreating myself from the community because of the Zoo's, Proshippers, and flat out creeps. Although, they lack the cognitive ability to comprehend why they are hated, I fully believe in them being bullied as curating that kind of BS is absolutely disgusting and dispicable people would explore such things because they "enjoy it", "voucher for it", or their "traumas made them like it". Grow up and if you are an adult supporting that then you are a failure as an indivdual with no place in society and should be culled if you're willing to take accountability and change for the good. Why spread disgust like MAP'S, ZOO'S, INCEL INCEST lovers, and etc to others and cause further trauma to another person or expose it to a minor? I really dont care if it happened to you, you obviously know its wrong and are actievely choosing to indulge in it.

I love drawing my charatcers which are Furries or PonyTown Oc's that I've made, I usually never really post my art due to art theft in the past and keep it under lock & key for personal artwork on my personal TH(Toyhouse). Please do not ask for my personal TH as it's meant only for my discretion, not for public or even friend accesible. I'm not trying to be an asshole to you but I'd like for you to respect that. However, You can find places where I post my artwork in the links I've provided and wont mind if you follow those accounts. I tend to make art for those who do or have really cool designs that i enjoy, just dont expect free art from me as if you are intitled to it, that's just rude. I use an Ipad 11 with Procreate.

I enjoy socailizing but encounter a short socail battery, however I make a great listener and can only offer advice based off my expirences and knowledge of the subject in a way that I hope helps you. So dont think that you're botering me or overwhelming me by talking to me more than I'm responding. I don't mind being friends either and hanging out on PT, even if it's to listen to the ambience of the game as we do our own things off tab. Please ask before shipping your characters with mine as some of them are already taken Oc's or have no desire to be in a relationship (not in Multiple Personality disorder, I'm talking about my OC's as indivduals if that helps).

*Will Fill In later*

Please keep in mind that this will change as time goes on and if i have the actual time to do it.
